# Finding & Navigating

Zed provides several ways to move around your codebase quickly. Here's an overview of the main navigation tools.

## Command Palette

The Command Palette ({#kb command_palette::Toggle}) is your gateway to almost everything in Zed. Type a few characters to filter commands, then press Enter to execute.

[Learn more about the Command Palette →](./command-palette.md)

## File Finder

Open any file in your project with {#kb file_finder::Toggle}. Type part of the filename or path to narrow results.

## Project Search

Search across all files with {#kb pane::DeploySearch}. Start typing in the search field to begin searching—results appear as you type.

Results appear in a [multibuffer](./multibuffers.md), letting you edit matches in place.

To disable automatic search and require pressing Enter instead, open the Settings Editor ({#kb zed::OpenSettings}), search for "search on input", and toggle the setting off. Or add this to your settings.json:

```json
{
  "search_on_input": false
}
```

## Go to Definition

Jump to where a symbol is defined with {#kb editor::GoToDefinition} (or `Cmd+Click` / `Ctrl+Click`). If there are multiple definitions, they open in a multibuffer.

## Tab Switcher

Quickly switch between open tabs with {#kb tab_switcher::Toggle}. Tabs are sorted by recent use—keep holding Ctrl and press Tab to cycle through them.
